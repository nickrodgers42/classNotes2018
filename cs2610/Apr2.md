# Exam Review

Review Django
* Templates - what they are and how to use them
* What is Django? (what is it doing, what problem is it trying to solve)
* What design paradigm does Django adhere to?
    * Basically Model View Controller

HTML forms
* method="" how to send the data
* action="" Where to send the data
* ```<input>```, and related elements

CRUD
* Create = make a new Item
* Read = retrieve data
* Update = modify an existing item
* Delete = Remove an item

POST, GET, PUT, DELETE
* Idempotent
* Safe
