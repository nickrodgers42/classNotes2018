# Class 3 March 2017

We went over some problems that we may have encountered when trying to do operations with commands and words in the last assignment

use strdup for your words.c_str()

## File Descriptors

File Descriptors are low level representations of files

System calls which operate on File Descriptors:
* open()
* close()
* write()
* read()
* dup
* dup2()
* pipe()

We will be using dup2(), pipe() and close() in our shell
